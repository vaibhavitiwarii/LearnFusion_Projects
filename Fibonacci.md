Creating a Fibonacci generator in Python can be done in a few different ways. Here are two common methods: using a generator function with yield and using an iterative approach.

Method 1: Generator Function with yield
A generator function allows you to iterate through the Fibonacci sequence without storing the entire sequence in memory. This is efficient for generating large sequences on-the-fly.

python
Copy code
def fibonacci_generator():
    a, b = 0, 1
    while True:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

# Example usage:
fib_gen = fibonacci_generator()
for _ in range(10):  # Generate the first 10 Fibonacci numbers
    print(next(fib_gen))
Method 2: Iterative Approach
If you prefer a more traditional approach, you can use an iterative function that returns a list of Fibonacci numbers up to a specified count.

python
Copy code
def fibonacci_list(n):
    fib_sequence = []
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        fib_sequence.append(a)
        a, b = b, a + b
    return fib_sequence

# Example usage:
print(fibonacci_list(10))  # Print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers
Both methods have their use cases:

Generator Function: Useful when you need to generate an indefinite sequence or handle large sequences without consuming much memory.
Iterative Function: Useful when you need a specific number of Fibonacci numbers and prefer working with a list.
Feel free to choose the method that best suits your needs!
